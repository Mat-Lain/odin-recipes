    <h2>Buttermilk Pancakes II</h2>
    
    <p>light and fluffy pancake that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>

    <br> <h3>Igredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar </li>
      <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda </li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <br> <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, 
        beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs and melted butter. 
        Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li> <br>

        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. 
          You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready!</li> <br>

          <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture, using a wooden spoon or fork to blend. Stir until it's just blended together. 
            Do not over stir! Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, 
            using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
